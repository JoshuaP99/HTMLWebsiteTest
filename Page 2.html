        Hello! My name is Joshua and I've been working in the architecture 
        world since 2020 working as an intern architect/draftsman. I also have experience
        in the IT world as well which I found to be one of the most rewarding experiences
        I've had in my professional career.
    </p>

        I am a very flexible worker who loves to work hands 
        on and delve into my work. Problem solving is one of my strong suits and 
        I always find myself to be self motivated to get the answers I need when it 
        comes to work. Working in architecture has taught me a lot about discipline 
        and being a diligent worker. The work can be tough and there isn't always a right 
        answer but you have to think on your feet and always be ready to take action. 
    </p>

        In my personal time I love to read, play games, and tinker with electronics. 
        I love to learn how things are put together and how they work. Working with 
        hardware and software has been a passion of mine since I was in high school 
        and have always found myself working with electronics. My family always 
        described me as the IT guy since I would always help everyone whenever 
        they needed help troubleshooting. I find there is no better feeling than 
        solving a problem or getting to the root of an issue on your own and being 
        able to share that knowledge with others.
